This is James Liao. I am currently working on a M.S. degree of computer science at [National Tsing Hua University](https://www.nthu.edu.tw/), supervised by Professor [Shang-Hong Lai](http://www.cs.nthu.edu.tw/~lai/). 

My research interests include **self-supervised learning**, **unsupervised learning**, and **few-shot learning** in the speech and NLP domain.
